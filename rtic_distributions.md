### RTIC distributions 

#### Definition 
An RTIC distribution is a rust crate that exposes the RTIC attribute proc-macro **implemented for a specific hardware architecture, or for a specific micro-controller, or even for a specific target use case (with non-standard syntax)**. For example, we could have a distribution for single core cortex-m devices, another distribution specifically tailored for the multicore RP2040, a distribution for risc-v architecture ... etc. 

The responsibility for a distribution crate is to:
1) Implement the **low level hardware specific** details and provide/bind that to the hardware agnostic **RTIC compilation passes**.
2) Integrate a selection of **compatible** Compilation passes and optionally expose them to the user as a set of **features** which the user can select to enable.
3) Expose the RTIC proc macro generated by `RticMacroBuilder` after performing the previous two steps

Distributions allow the RTIC code-base growth more controllable and provides an alternative approach to the older approach in which all the hardware specific details all belong to a single crate maintained by the RTIC team, and users choose an implementation for some specific hardware is chosen by enabling a corresponding rust feature for their target hardware.
